Upgrading Graylog
-----------------

[[from-1.x-to-2.x]]
From 1.x to 2.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[elasticsearch-2.x]]
Elasticsearch 2.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The embedded Elasticsearch node being used by Graylog has been upgraded
to Elasticsearch 2.x which includes some breaking changes. Graylog 2.x
does not work with Elasticsearch 1.x anymore and cannot communicate with
existing Elasticsearch 1.x clusters.

Please see
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/breaking-changes.html[Breaking
changes in Elasticsearch 2.x] for details.

The blog article
https://www.elastic.co/blog/key-point-to-be-aware-of-when-upgrading-from-elasticsearch-1-to-2[Key
points to be aware of when upgrading from Elasticsearch 1.x to 2.x] also
contains interesting information about the upgrade path from
Elasticsearch 1.x to 2.x.

[[multicast-discovery]]
Multicast Discovery
+++++++++++++++++++

Multicast discovery has been removed from Elasticsearch 2.x (although it
is still provided as an Elasticsearch plugin for now).

To reflect this change, the
`elasticsearch_discovery_zen_ping_unicast_hosts` now has to contain the
address of at least one Elasticsearch node in the cluster which Graylog
can connect to.

[[default-network-host]]
Default network host
++++++++++++++++++++

The network interface which Elasticsearch binds to
(`elasticsearch_network_host`) has been changed to localhost (i. e.
`127.0.0.1` or `::1`); see
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/breaking_20_network_changes.html#_bind_to_localhost[Network
changes/Bind to localhost].

If Elasticsearch is not running on the same machine,
`elasticsearch_network_host` must be set to a host name or an IP address
which can be accessed by the other Elasticsearch nodes in the cluster.

[[index-range-types]]
Index range types
+++++++++++++++++

_______________________________________________________________________
*note*

This step needs to be performed before the update to Elasticsearch 2.x!
_______________________________________________________________________

Some Graylog versions stored meta information about indices in
elasticsearch, alongside the messages themselves. Since Elasticsearch
2.0 having multiple types with conflicting mappings is no longer
possible, which means that the `index_range` type must be removed before
upgrading to Elasticsearch 2.x.

Find out if your setup is affected by running (replace `$elasticsearch`
with the address of one of your Elasticsearch nodes)
`curl -XGET $elasticsearch:9200/_all/_mapping/index_range; echo`

If the output is `{}` you are not affected and can skip this step.

Otherwise, you need to delete the `index_range` type, Graylog does not
use it anymore.

As Graylog sets older indices to read-only, first we need to remove the
write block on those indices. Since we'll be working with
Elasticsearch's JSON output, we recommend installing the `jq` utility
which should be available on all popular package managers or directly at
https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[GitHub].

....
for i in `curl -s -XGET $elasticsearch:9200/_all/_mapping/index_range | jq -r "keys[]"`; do
    echo -n "Updating index $i: "
    echo -n "curl -XPUT $elasticsearch:9200/$i/_settings -d '{\"index.blocks.read_only\":false, \"index.blocks.write\":false}' : "
    curl -XPUT $elasticsearch:9200/$i/_settings -d '{"index.blocks.read_only":false, "index.blocks.write":false}'
    echo
done
....

The output for each of the curl commands should be
`{"acknowledged":true}`. Next we have to delete the `index_range`
mapping. We can perform this via the next command.

___________________________________________________________________________________________
*note*

We strongly recommend to perform this on a single index before running
this bulk command.::
  This operation can be expensive to perform if you have a lot of
  affected indices.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

....
for i in `curl -s -XGET $elasticsearch:9200/_all/_mapping/index_range | jq -r "keys[]"`; do
    echo -n "Updating index $i: "
    curl -XDELETE $elasticsearch:9200/$i/index_range
    echo
done
....

It is not strictly necessary to set the indices back to read only, but
if you prefer to do that, note the index names and commands during the
first step and change the `false` into `true`.

[[graylog-index-template]]
Graylog Index Template
++++++++++++++++++++++

Graylog applies a custom
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/indices-templates.html[index
template] to ensure that the indexed messages adhere to a specific
schema.

Unfortunately the index template being used by Graylog 1.x is
incompatible with Elasticsearch 2.x and has to be removed prior to
upgrading.

In order to
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/indices-templates.html#delete[delete
the index template] the following curl command has to be issued against
on of the Elasticsearch nodes:

....
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/_template/graylog-internal
....

Graylog will automatically create the new index template on the next
startup.

[[dots-in-field-names]]
Dots in field names
+++++++++++++++++++

One of the most important breaking changes in Elasticsearch 2.x is that
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/breaking_20_mapping_changes.html#_field_names_may_not_contain_dots[field
names may not contain dots] anymore.

Using the
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-migration[Elasticsearch
Migration Plugin] might help to highlight some potential pitfalls if an
existing Elasticsearch 1.x cluster should be upgraded to Elasticsearch
2.x.

[[mongodb]]
MongoDB
^^^^^^^

Graylog 2.x requires MongoDB 2.4 or newer. We recommend using MongoDB
3.x and the https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.2/core/wiredtiger/[WiredTiger
storage engine].

When upgrading from MongoDB 2.0 or 2.2 to a supported version, make sure
to read the https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/[Release
Notes] for the particular version.

[[log4j-2-migration]]
Log4j 2 migration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graylog switched its logging backend from
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/[Log4j 1.2] to
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4j 2].

Please refer to the
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html[Log4j
Migration Guide] for information on how to update your existing logging
configuration.

[[dead-letters-feature-removed]]
Dead Letters feature removed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Dead Letters feature, which stored messages that couldn't be indexed
into Elasticsearch for various reasons, has been removed.

This feature has been disabled by default. If you have enabled the
feature the configuration file, please check the `dead_letters_enabled`
collection in MongoDB and remove it afterwards.

[[removed-configuration-settings]]
Removed configuration settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[index-retention-and-rotation-settings]]
Index Retention and Rotation Settings
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In 2.0.0 the index rotation and retention settings have been moved from
the Graylog server config file to the database and are now configurable
via the web interface.

The old settings from the `graylog.conf` or
`/etc/graylog/server/server.conf` will be migrated to the database.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*warning*

When you upgrade from a 1.x version and you modified any
rotation/retention settings,::
  please make sure you *KEEP* your old settings in the config file so
  the migration process will add your old settings to the database!
  Otherwise the retention process will use the default settings and
  might remove a lot of indices.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

[[overview]]
Overview
++++++++

Some settings, which have been deprecated in previous versions, have
finally been removed from the Graylog configuration file.

[[changed-configuration-defaults]]
Changed configuration defaults
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For better consistency, the defaults of some configuration settings have
been changed after the project has been renamed from _Graylog2_ to
__Graylog__.

[[changed-prefixes-for-configuration-override]]
Changed prefixes for configuration override
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the past it was possible to override configuration settings in
Graylog using environment variables or Java system properties with a
specific prefix.

For better consistency, these prefixes have been changed after the
project has been renamed from _Graylog2_ to __Graylog__.

[[rest-api-changes]]
REST API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output ID key for the list of outputs in the `/streams/*` endpoints
has been changed from `_id` to `id`.

[[web-interface-config-changes]]
Web Interface Config Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The web interface has been integrated into the Graylog server and was
rewritten in React. Therefore configuring it has changed fundamentally
since the last version(s). Please consult configuring_webif for details.

Please take note that the `application.context` configuration parameter
present in Graylog 1.x (and earlier) is not existing anymore. The web
interface can currently only be served without a path prefix.
