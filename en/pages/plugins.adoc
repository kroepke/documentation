General information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graylog comes with a stable plugin API for the following plugin types
since Graylog 1.0:

* *Inputs:* Accept/write any messages into Graylog
* *Outputs:* Forward messages to other endpoints in real-time
* *Services:* Run at startup and able to implement any functionality
* *Alarm Callbacks:* Called when a stream alert condition has been
triggered
* *Filters:* Transform/drop incoming messages during processing
* *REST API Resources:* A REST resource to expose as part of the
`graylog-server` REST API
* *Periodical:* Called at periodical intervals during server runtime

The first step for writing a plugin is creating a skeleton that is the
same for each type of plugin. The next chapter is explaining how to do
this and will then go over to chapters explaining plugin types in
detail.

[[prerequisites]]
Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What you need in your development environment before starting is:

_________________________________
* https://git-scm.com[git]
* https://maven.apache.org[maven]
_________________________________

There are lots of different ways to get those on your local machine,
unfortunately we cannot list all of them, so please refer to your
operating system-specific documentation,

[[creating-a-plugin-skeleton]]
Creating a plugin skeleton
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get started is to use our
https://github.com/graylog2/graylog-project[Graylog meta project], which
will create a complete plugin project infrastructure will all required
classes, build definitions, and configurations. Using the meta project
allows you to have the
https://github.com/graylog2/graylog2-server[Graylog server project] and
your own plugins (or 3rd party plugins) in the same project, which means
that you can run and debug everything in your favorite IDE or navigate
seamlessly in the code base.

Maven is a widely used build tool for Java, that comes pre-installed on
many operating systems or can be installed using most package managers.
Make sure that you have at least version 3 before you go on.

Use it like this:

....
$ git clone git@github.com:Graylog2/graylog-project.git
....

This will create a checkout of the meta project in your current work
dir. Now change to the `graylog-project` directory and execute the step
which to download the necessary base modules:

....
$ scripts/bootstrap
....

Now you can bootstrap the plugin you want to write from here, by doing:

....
$ scripts/bootstrap-plugin jira-alarmcallback
....

It will ask you a few questions about the plugin you are planning to
build. Let's say you work for a company called ACMECorp and want to
build an alarm callback plugin that creates a JIRA ticket for each alarm
that is triggered:

....
groupId: com.acmecorp
version: 1.0.0
package: com.acmecorp
pluginClassName: JiraAlarmCallback
....

Note that you do not have to tell the archetype wizard what kind of
plugin you want to build because it is creating the generic plugin
skeleton for you but nothing that is related to the actual
implementation. More on this in the example plugin chapters later.

You now have a new folder called `graylog-plugin-jira-alarmcallback`
that includes a complete plugin skeleton including Maven build files.
Every Java IDE out there can now import the project automatically
without any required further configuration.

In https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] for example you can
just use the _File -> Open_ dialog to open the `graylog-project`
directory as a fully configured Java project, which should include the
Graylog server and your plugin as submodules.

Please pay close attention to the
https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-project/blob/master/README.md[README
file] of the Graylog meta project and follow any further instructions
listed there to set up your IDE properly.

If you want to continue working on the command line, you can do the
following to compile the server and your plugin:

....
$ mvn package
....

[[change-some-default-values]]
Change some default values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the `JiraAlarmCallbackMetaData.java` file and customize the default
values like the plugin description, the website URI, and so on.
Especially the author name etc. should be changed.

Now go on with implementing the actual login in one of the example
plugin chapters below.

[[example-alarm-callback-plugin]]
Example Alarm Callback plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's assume you still want to build the mentioned JIRA AlarmCallback
plugin. First open the `JiraAlarmCallback.java` file and let it
implement the `AlarmCallback` interface:

....
public class JiraAlarmCallback implements AlarmCallback
....

Your IDE should offer you to create the methods you need to implement:

*public void initialize(Configuration configuration) throws
AlarmCallbackConfigurationException*

This is called once at the very beginning of the lifecycle of this
plugin. It is common practive to store the `Configuration` as a private
member for later access.

*public void call(Stream stream, AlertCondition.CheckResult checkResult)
throws AlarmCallbackException*

This is the actual alarm callback being triggered. Implement your login
that creates a JIRA ticket here.

*public ConfigurationRequest getRequestedConfiguration()*

Plugins can request configurations. The UI in the Graylog web interface
is generated from this information and the filled out configuration
values are passed back to the plugin in
`initialize(Configuration configuration)`.

This is an example configuration request:

....
final ConfigurationRequest configurationRequest = new ConfigurationRequest();
configurationRequest.addField(new TextField(
        "service_key", "Service key", "", "JIRA API token. You can find this token in your account settings.",
        ConfigurationField.Optional.NOT_OPTIONAL)); // required, must be filled out
configurationRequest.addField(new BooleanField(
        "use_https", "HTTPs", true,
        "Use HTTP for API communication?"));
....

*public String getName()*

Return a human readable name of this plugin.

*public Map<String, Object> getAttributes()*

Return attributes that might be interesting to be shown under the alarm
callback in the Graylog web interface. It is common practice to at least
return the used configuration here.

*public void checkConfiguration() throws ConfigurationException*

Throw a `ConfigurationException` if the user should have entered missing
or invalid configuration parameters.

[[registering-the-plugin]]
Registering the plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You now have to register your plugin in the
`JiraAlarmCallbackModule.java` file to make `graylog-server` load the
alarm callback when launching. The reason for the manual registering is
that a plugin could consist of multiple plugin types. Think of the
generated plugin file as a bundle of multiple plugins.

Register your new plugin using the `configure()` method:

....
@Override
protected void configure() {
    addAlarmCallback(JiraAlarmCallback.class);
}
....

[[creating-a-plugin-for-the-web-interface]]
Creating a plugin for the web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes your plugin is not only supposed to work under the hoods
inside a Graylog server as an input, output, alarm callback, etc. but
you also want to contribute previously nonexisting functionality to
Graylog's web interface. Since version 2.0 this is now possible. When
using the most recent
Graylog meta project <https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-project> to
bootstrap the plugin skeleton, you are already good to go for this.
Otherwise please see our chapter about creating_plugin_skeleton.

The Graylog web interface is written in JavaScript, based on
https://facebook.github.io/react/[React]. It is built using
http://webpack.github.io[webpack], which is bundling all JavaScript code
(and other files you use, like stylesheets, fonts, images, even audio or
video files if you need them) into chunks digestable by your browser and
http://npmjs.com[npm], which is managing our external (and own)
dependencies. During the build process all of this will be bundled and
included in the jar file of your plugin.

This might be overwhelming at first if you are not accustomed to
JS-development, but fortunately we have set up a lot to make writing
plugins easier for you!

[[prerequisites-1]]
Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use our proposed way for creating_plugin_skeleton, and followed
the part about the plugin_prerequisites, you are already good to go for
building a plugin with a web part. *All you need is a running Graylog
server on your machine.* Everything else is fetched at build time!

[[how-to-start-development]]
How to start development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Getting up and running with a web development environment is as easy as
this:

....
$ git clone https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-project.git
[...]
$ cd graylog-project
$ scripts/bootstrap
[...]
$ scripts/bootstrap-plugin your-plugin
[...]
$ scripts/start-web-dev
[...]
$ open http://localhost:8080
....

This clones the meta project repository, bootstraps the required modules
and starts the web server. It even tries to open a browser window going
to it (probably working on Mac OS X only).

If your Graylog server is not running on `http://localhost:12900`, then
you need to edit `graylog2-server/graylog2-web-interface/config.js` (in
your `graylog-project` directory) and adapt the `gl2ServerUrl`
parameter.

[[web-plugin-structure]]
Web Plugin structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are the relevant files and directories in your plugin directory
for the web part of it:

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
webpack.config.js::
  This is the configuration file for the
  http://webpack.github.io[webpack] module bundler. Most of it is
  already preconfigured by our `PluginWebpackConfig` class, so the file
  is very small. You can override/extend every configuration option by
  passing a webpack snippet though.
build.config.js.sample::
  In this file you can customize some of the parameters of the build.
  There is one mandatory parameter named `web_src_path` which defines
  the absolute or relative location to a checkout of the
  https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server[Graylog source
  repository].
package.json::
  This is a standard http://npmjs.com[npm] JSON file describing the web
  part of your plugin, especially its dependencies. You can read more
  about its format https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json[here].
src/web::
  This is where the actual code for thw web part of your plugin goes to.
  For the start there is a simple `index.jsx` file, which shows you how
  to register your plugin and the parts it provides with the Graylog web
  interface. We will get to this in detail later.

[[best-practices-for-web-plugin-development]]
Best practices for web plugin development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[using-eslint]]
Using ESLint
^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://eslint.org[ESLint] is an awesome tool for linting JavaScript
code. It makes sure that any written code is in line with general best
practises and the project-specific coding style/guideline. We at Graylog
are striving to make the best use of this tools as possible, to help our
developers and you to generate top quality code with little bugs.
Therefore we highly recommend to enable it for a Graylog plugin you are
writing.

[[code-splitting]]
Code Splitting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both the web interface and plugins for it depend on a number of
libraries like React, RefluxJS and others. To prevent those getting
bundled into _both_ the web interface _and_ plugin assets, therefore
wasting space or causing problems (especially React does not like to be
present more than once), we extract those into a commons chunk which is
reused by the web interface and plugins.

This has no consequences for you as a plugin author, because the
configuration to make use of this is already generated for you when
using the meta project or the maven archetype. But here are some details
about it:

Common libraries are built into a separate `vendor` bundle using an own
configuration file named
https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/blob/2.0.1/graylog2-web-interface/webpack.vendor.js[webpack.vendor.js].
Using the
https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/list-of-plugins[DLLPlugin] a
https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/blob/2.0.1/graylog2-web-interface/webpack.vendor.js#L31-L34[manifest
is extracted] which allow us to reuse the generated bundle. This is then
imported in our main
https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/blob/2.0/graylog2-web-interface/webpack.config.js#L51[web
interface webpack configuration file] and the corresponding
https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-web-plugin/blob/master/src/PluginWebpackConfig.js#L45[generated
webpack config file for plugins].

[[building-plugins]]
Building plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building the plugin is easy because the meta project has created all
necessary files and settings for you. Just run `mvn package` either from
the meta project's directory (to build the server _and_ the plugin) or
from the plugin directory (to build the plugin only):

....
$ mvn package
....

This will generate a `.jar` file in `target/` that is the complete
plugin file:

....
$ ls target/jira-alarmcallback-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
target/jira-alarmcallback-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
....

[[installing-and-loading-plugins]]
Installing and loading plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only thing you need to do to run the plugin in Graylog is to copy
the `.jar` file to your plugins folder that is configured in your
`graylog.conf`. The default is just `plugins/` relative from your
`graylog-server` directory.

This is a list of default plugin locations for the different
installation methods.

Restart `graylog-server` and the plugin should be available to use from
the web interface immediately.
