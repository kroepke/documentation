Graylog Marketplace

GELF libraries and more content built by Graylog developers and
community members.

[[github-integration]]
GitHub integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Marketplace is deeply integrated with GitHub. You sign-in with your
GitHub account if you want to submit content and only have to select an
existing repository to list on the Marketplace.

From there on you manage your releases and code changes in GitHub. The
Marketplace will automatically update your content.

There is no need to sign-in if you only want to browse or download
content.

[[readme-content]]
README content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We kindly ask you to provide an as descriptive as possible `README` file
with your submission. This file will be displayed on the Marketplace
detail page and should provide the following information:

* What is it.
* Why would you want to use it? (Use cases)
* Do you have to register somewhere to get for example an API token?
* How to install and configure it.
* How to use it in a Graylog context.

Take a look at the
https://marketplace.graylog.org/addons/974efcc3-8d78-4847-becd-0f26821d2646[Splunk
plug-in] as an example.

The README supports
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown[Markdown] for formatting.
You cannot submit content that does not contain a `README` file.

[[license]]
License
^^^^^^^

You cannot submit content that does not contain a `LICENSE` or `COPYING`
file. We recommend to consult
http://choosealicense.com[ChooseALicense.com] if you are unsure which
license to use.

[[types-of-add-ons]]
4 Types of Add-Ons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plug-Ins: Code that extends Graylog to support a specific use case that
it doesnâ€™t support out of the box.

Content Pack: A file that can be uploaded into your Graylog system that
sets up streams, inputs, extractors, dashboards, etc. to support a given
log source or use case.

GELF Library: A library for a programming language or logging framework
that supports sending log messages in GELF format for easy integration
and pre-structured messages.

Other Solutions: Any other content or guide that helps you integrate
Graylog with an external system or device. For example, how to configure
a specific device to support a format Graylog understands out of the
box.

[[contributing-plug-ins]]
Contributing plug-ins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You created a Graylog plugin <plugins> and want to list it in the
Marketplace? This is great. Here are the simple steps to follow:

1.  Create a GitHub repository for your plugin
2.  Include a README <mpreadme> and a LICENSE <mplicense> file in the
repository.
3.  Push all your code to the repository.
4.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a GitHub
release] and give it the name of the plugin version. For example `0.1`.
The Marketplace will always show and link the latest version. You can
upload as many release artifacts as you want here. For example the
`.jar` file together with `DEB` and `RPM` files. The Marketplace will
link to the detail page of a release for downloads.
5.  Submit the repository to the Marketplace

[[contributing-content-packs]]
Contributing content packs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graylog content packs can be shared on the Marketplace by following
these steps:

1.  Export a Graylog content pack from the Graylog Web Interface and
save the generated JSON in a file called `content_pack.json`.
2.  Create a GitHub repository for your content pack
3.  Include a README <mpreadme> and a LICENSE <mplicense> file in the
repository.
4.  Include the `content_pack.json` file in the root of your GitHub
repository.
5.  Submit the repository to the Marketplace

[[contributing-gelf-libraries]]
Contributing GELF libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A GELF library can be added like this:

1.  Create a GitHub repository for your GELF library.
2.  Include a README <mpreadme> and a LICENSE <mplicense> file in the
repository.
3.  Describe where to download and how to use the GELF library in the
`README`.

[[contributing-other-content]]
Contributing other content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You want to contribute content that does not really fit into the other
categories but describes how to integrate a certain system or make it
send messages to Graylog?

This is how you can do it:

1.  Create a GitHub repository for your content
2.  Include a README <mpreadme> and a LICENSE <mplicense> file in the
repository.
3.  All content goes into the `README`.
